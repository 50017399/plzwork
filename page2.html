				<h2>What Is WebXR&nbsp;</h2>
				<p>The XR stands for “Extended Reality” which intended to include AR, VR and all other immersive technologies such as mobile devices with positional tracking or fixed display with head tracking abilities. WebXR is a new API standard for web developers to create VR or AR applications without having to deal directly with each hardware. Users can use only web browser to start viewing VR/AR content without having to install extra plugins or software. Developers can write the code once and it will work with all devices from different brands (Oculus, Vive, Windows Mixed VR, etc.)</p>
